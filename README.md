## Versions (To do)
_Please add the software versions here later_

## Routing
* The base path `/` currently routes to `/welcome`, the "you successfully logged in page". In the future, this should route to the task overview page.
* Routing can be configured in `config/routes.rb`
* By default, every page requires the user to be logged in, if he is not, he'll be redirected to the login (which is one of the pages, which can be opened without login, the second one is the account creation)

## CSS
The CSS styling works with html classes and tag types. Currently, every styling happens in `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`. If there's more explanation necessary, please feel free to ask me (Linus).
